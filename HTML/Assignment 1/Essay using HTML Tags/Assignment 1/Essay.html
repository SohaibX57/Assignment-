                <dfn>Money laundering</dfn> is the process of <i>making illegally-gained money appear legitimate.</i>
                Criminals use many
                techniques to hide the origin of the money they earn from activities such as <b>drug trafficking,
                    corruption,
                    fraud, and organized crime.</b> This practice harms economies, weakens public trust, and helps
                criminal
                networks
                grow stronger.

                WHAT IS MONEY LAUNDERING?
            </h3>
        </dt>
        <dd><cite>Money laundering</cite> usually involves three stages: placement, layering, and integration. In the
            placement
            stage,
            illegal cash enters the financial system. During layering, the money is moved through many transactions to
            hide
            its origin. Finally, in integration, the funds are reintroduced into the economy as apparently legal assets.
            <strong>Understanding these stages helps investigators trace and stop criminal funds.</strong>

    <h4>
        CAUSES OF MONEY LAUNDERING:
    </h4>

    <ul type="circle">
        <li>

            Corruption and lack of transparency in public institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
            High profits from illegal activities (e.g., drug sales, smuggling).
        </li>

        <li>
            Weak financial controls and poor regulation in some countries.
        </li>

        <li>
            Demand for anonymity and secrecy by criminal groups.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        COMMON METHODS (EXAMPLES):
    </h4>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            Structuring or “smurfing”: breaking a large sum into many small deposits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shell companies and fake invoices: creating businesses that exist only on paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Trade-based laundering: falsifying import/export values to move money across borders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of cash-intensive businesses: restaurants or shops used to mix legal and illegal cash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Digital methods: cryptocurrencies and online payment platforms are increasingly used.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        EFFECTS ON SOCIETY AND THE ECONOMY:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Money laundering damages societies in several ways. It distorts markets by giving unfair advantage to
        crime-linked businesses. It reduces tax revenue because income is hidden. Corruption and weak institutions
        grow
        when criminals gain financial power, and investors may withdraw from countries that are known for lax
        controls.
        <em>
            Ultimately, ordinary citizens suffer through higher prices, poor public services, and greater insecurity.
        </em>
    </p>

    <h4>
        PREVENTION AND CONTROL (WHAT CAN BE DONE):
    </h4>

    <ol>

        <li>
            <del>Powerfull</del> <ins>Strong</ins> regulation and enforcement of financial laws.
        </li>
        <li>
            Robust customer checks for banks and businesses (Know Your Customer — KYC).
        </li>
        <li>
            International cooperation and information-sharing between law enforcement agencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Public awareness and good corporate governance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of technology and data analysis to detect suspicious transactions.
        </li>
    </ol>

    CONCLUSION:
    Money laundering is more than a financial crime —
    <blockquote>
        <q>It is a threat to economic stability and social welfare.</q>
    </blockquote>
    Combating it requires coordinated action from governments, financial institutions, businesses, and citizens.
    With stricter rules, smarter technology, and stronger cooperation across borders, the flow of illegal funds
    can
    be reduced and societies can be made safer.
